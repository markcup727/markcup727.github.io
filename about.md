## About

I’m a system-level engineer working on flagship SoCs, with a focus on performance under power and thermal constraints.  
My work sits at the boundary between silicon limits and software control: firmware loops, policy design, and cross-subsystem debugging.

### What you can expect from me
- I turn ambiguous performance issues into clear hypotheses and measurable experiments
- I’m comfortable across CPU/GPU, power/thermal, and system integration boundaries
- I prefer stable, repeatable solutions over “one-off fixes”

### (Optional) Add audio or video later
Put your file into `assets/audio/` or `assets/video/`, then paste one of these examples:

**Audio**
```html
<audio controls src="{{ '/assets/audio/intro.mp3' | relative_url }}"></audio>
```

**Video**
```html
<video controls width="720" src="{{ '/assets/video/intro.mp4' | relative_url }}"></video>
```
