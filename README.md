# Personal Portfolio (GitHub Pages, easy-to-edit)

This site is built with **GitHub Pages + Jekyll** and is designed to be:
- **Easy to maintain** (edit Markdown files, no build tools needed)
- **Visually persuasive** (three clear entry points for different interviewers)
- **Private to edit** (only repo collaborators can change content)

## Quick publish (User site: `YOURNAME.github.io`)
1. Create a new repository named **`YOURNAME.github.io`** (YOURNAME = your GitHub username).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo root.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (root)
4. Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy.
5. Visit: `https://YOURNAME.github.io`

## Editing content
You mostly edit these files:
- `index.md` (home)
- `about.md` (personal intro)
- `domain/performance.md`
- `domain/system.md`
- `domain/architecture.md`

## Adding audio/video later
- Put files into `assets/audio/` or `assets/video/`
- Then add a link or HTML `<audio>` / `<video>` tag in `about.md` (template included there).

## Optional custom domain
You can add a custom domain in Settings → Pages later.
