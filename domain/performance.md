## Performance & Power Optimization

### The problem I solve

Modern SoCs are often limited by **power and thermal constraints**, not peak compute.  
The challenge is to keep performance stable while staying within safe power and thermal limits.

### What I do

- Post-silicon performance tuning on flagship SoCs  
- DVFS and thermal mitigation strategies with firmware control (e.g., MCUPM)  
- Cross-layer debugging across CPU/GPU, power, and thermal signals  

### Why it matters

- Better performance-per-watt under real user workloads  
- More predictable sustained performance  
- Faster root-cause analysis and shorter bring-up cycles
