## System Integration & Control

### The problem I solve

A flagship SoC is not “CPU + GPU” — it is one **coupled system**.  
Performance and stability depend on coordination across power domains, interconnect, firmware, and drivers.

### What I do

- Firmware-based power control loops (MCUPM) to offload V/F management  
- Workload-aware policies to balance responsiveness, stability, and efficiency  
- Integration mindset across CPU, GPU and memory  

### Why it matters

- Stable system behavior under diverse workloads  
- Cleaner interfaces and fewer integration surprises  
- Better performance consistency for end users
