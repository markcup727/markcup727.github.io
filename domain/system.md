## System Integration & Control

### The problem I solve
A flagship SoC is not “CPU + GPU + modem” — it is one coupled system. Performance and stability depend on coordination across power domains, interconnect, firmware, and drivers.

### What I do
- Firmware-based power control loops (MCUPM) to offload V/F management
- Workload-aware policies to balance responsiveness, stability, and efficiency
- Integration mindset across CPU, GPU, modem, ISP, and memory

### Why it matters
- Stable system behavior under diverse workloads
- Cleaner interfaces and fewer integration surprises
- Better performance consistency for end users

**What to add here later (optional):**
- A system diagram showing control paths (CPU ↔ MCUPM ↔ PMIC)
- A short list of “integration checklists” you use
