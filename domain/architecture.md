## Architecture & Modeling

### The problem I solve
When hardware is fixed, the fastest path forward is often better reasoning: modeling bottlenecks, validating trade-offs, and using the right experiments to confirm.

### What I do
- Performance modeling for memory behavior (cache/memory effects)
- Trade-off driven thinking: latency vs throughput vs power
- Micro-benchmarks and profiling plans that map to architecture hypotheses

### Why it matters
- Better decisions earlier (before deep changes)
- Clearer communication with architects and cross-functional teams
- A repeatable method for performance argumentation

**What to add here later (optional):**
- A small cache/memory model repo link
- A one-page “performance argument” example
