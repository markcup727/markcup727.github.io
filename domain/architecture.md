## Architecture & Modeling

### The problem I solve

When hardware is fixed, the fastest path forward is often better reasoning:  
modeling bottlenecks, validating trade-offs, and using the right experiments to confirm.

### What I do

- Performance modeling for memory behavior (cache / memory effects)  
- Trade-off driven thinking: latency vs throughput vs power  
- Micro-benchmarks and profiling plans that map to architecture hypotheses  

### Why it matters

- Better decisions earlier (before deep changes)  
- Clearer communication with architects and cross-functional teams  
- A repeatable method for performance argumentation
